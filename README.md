# Hi there, I'm **Asad** 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I'm a **Third-Year Computer Science Student** at Queen Mary University of London.

🌱 Currently enhancing my skills in **Python**, **Django**, **Java**, **Docker**, and exploring **Vue.js** for web development.

🛠️ **Final Year Project**: Building an interactive coding practice platform inspired by LeetCode, enhanced with an AI-powered assistant that provides progressive, context-aware hints. [AlgoAI](https://github.com/As4d/algo-ai) helps users develop a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures by guiding them step-by-step based on their current code and experience level - without giving away full solutions. The platform aims to make learning more intuitive, especially for beginners, by reducing frustration and promoting better problem-solving practices.
